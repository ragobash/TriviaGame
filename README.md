A generic bar trivia game

### How to Play
You will be given 30 seconds to answer each of 7 questions, with your results shown at the end. For every question you get incorrect, the text of the question will blur by 1px, simulating you becoming more intoxicated. If you get a question correct, then the question will sharpen by 1px, as well. Best of luck!
